> [Stanford의 CS229과목](http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus-autumn2018.html)의 [온라인 강의](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGwO_UgTS7I&list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU)을 듣고 나름대로 정리한 글입니다.


# Outline
## Overview of CS229

- Supervised Learning

Given a data set with label, find a mapping X -> Y
- Machine Learning strategies ( Learning Theory )
- Deep Learning
- Unsupervised Learning

Given a data set with no label, find a mapping X -> Y
- Reinforcement Learning
- Regression Problem vs Classfication Problem

In former case, Y is continuous while in classfication problem, Y is discrete.
